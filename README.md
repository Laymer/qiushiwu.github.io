I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science & Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota. I received my undergraduate B.A. in the Information Science & Engineering Department of the University of Science and Technology of China in 2018. My primary research interest is applications of program analysis techniques on operating systems such as the Linux kernel.

### Research

My research aims to protect widely used systems programs such as operating systems (OS) kernels with billions of users from security and reliability issues. Specifically, my research includes (1) developing fundamental techniques that enable precise and scalable program analysis and (2) studying and detecting critical security bugs in foundational programs. In the past two years, I have designed and implemented several automated analysis tools, which scale precise symbolic execution to OS kernels with 27 million lines of code and detected hundreds of security bugs in multiple widely used systems such as the Linux kernel and the OpenSSL library; these works have been published at prestigious conferences including IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, NDSS, , ESORICS, and etc. My works are impactful. On the one hand, the precise and scalable symbolic execution serves as a foundational technology that could benefit a variety of areas such as software engineering, systems, and compilers. On the other hand, my works are able to find a large number of critical security bugs in widely used programs with billions of users, thus can improve the security of computer systems, protect the integrity of user data and the privacy of users.
